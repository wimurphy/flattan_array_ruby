# ruby_flatten

Recursive flattening method in ruby.

#### flatten_all_types:
Flattens a nested array of all types

#### flatten_interget_only
Flattens a nested array of integers only

The flatten_integer and flatten_all_types methods are not necessary, but the make the testing cleaner. In a production environment you could comfortably use the recursive methods only.
